This section presents some of the common pitfalls you might face when using $specs2 and Scala

### vals vs lazy vals

The common symptom here is a `NullPointerException` for some attributes of your specification. You can refer to this [link](http://engineering.tapad.com/blog/2012/11/here-there-be-dragons-dangers-of-initialization-order-in-scala/) for an explanation of variable initialization in Scala. In the meantime the basic fix is to use a `lazy val` instead of a `val`.

### Lost expectations

You might expect the following specification to fail:${snippet{
class ShouldItFail extends Specification { def is = s2"""
  Should this example fail? $e1
"""
  def e1 = {
    1 must_== 100000 // do you expect this to fail
    10 must_== 10
  }
}
}}

However, as explained in ${see(Structure)} - Thrown expectations, the first expectation is lost because, by default, no exceptions are thrown in an acceptance specification.
In that case you can either:

 - create 2 examples having one expectation each
 - mix-in the `ThrownExpectations` trait

### No evidence parameter for AsResult

Here is a mysterious `AsResult` message
```
class MysteriousAsResult extends mutable.Specification {
  "Try this" in {
    1 must_== 1
    println("this is ok, right?")
  }
}

[error] could not find implicit value for evidence parameter of type org.specs2.execute.AsResult[Unit]
```

What's happening? Each example must return a value of type `T` where `T` has an `AsResult` instance. This is the case if `T` is a `Boolean`, a `MatchResult`, a ScalaCheck `Prop` etc... (see ${see(AsResultTypeclass)}). In the class above the return value is `Unit` which doesn't have an `AsResult` instance.

To fix this you can either:

 - either return `ok` after `println`
 - create your own matcher (see ${see(Matchers)}) and make sure you have a proper expectation for your example
 - add an `AsResult[Unit]` instance like this

${snippet{
implicit def unitAsResult: AsResult[Unit] = new AsResult[Unit] {
  def asResult(r: =>Unit) =
    ResultExecution.execute(r)(_ => Success())
}
}}

### Type mismatch

This is also a tricky one, showing the limitations of embedding a pseudo-natural language into a programming language:
```
class Inference extends mutable.Specification {
  "It doesn't mean what you think it does" >> {
    List(1, 2, 3) must not beNull
    List(1, 2) must have size(2)
  }
}

[error] type mismatch;
[error]  found   : List[Int]
[error]  required: org.specs2.matcher.Matcher[List[Int]]
[error]     List(1, 2) must have size(2)
[error]         ^
```

The first statement is parsed as `issue.must(not).beNull` as if `beNull` was a method expecting an argument on the next line (this is well explained in this [StackOverflow question](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14336699/specs2-multiple-matcher-expressions-unit-specification)).

The possible fixes are:

 - use parentheses around `beNull`, like this: `not(beNull)`
 - use a semi-column after the first line

### Yrangepos

The `Yrangepos` scalac option (see ${see(QuickStart)}) is necessary to get proper Fragment locations when using `s2` interpolated strings. However this option sometimes breaks some macros with messages like [`[info] Unpositioned tree #931`](https://github.com/non/kind-projector/issues/7). In that case you should remove that option from your build. You will still be able to use `s2` interpolation strings but fragment locations will be less precise.

### Custom output

You created a custom `Notifier` or another class for reporting and when you use it nothing happens. In that case add the `verbose` argument to the command line and you will get more messages including exceptions and stacktraces about what is going on.
