 This is a specification to check the 'Hello world' string

A $specs2 software specification is nothing more than a Scala class extending `org.specs2.Specification` and declaring a special `is` method. This method contains both plain text describing what the application should do but also some method calls containing a more formal specification of the expected behaviour.

### Execution

And this is it! Now you can execute your specification with a [*runner*](org.specs2.guide.Runners.html#Presentation) and observe the results:

```
> scala -cp ... specs2.run HelloWorldSpec

HelloWorldSpec

This is a specification to check the 'Hello world' string

The 'Hello world' string should
  + contain 11 characters
  + start with 'Hello'
  + end with 'world'

 * ${"structure" ~/ Structure} your specification using one of the 2 major "styles" of specifications: "Acceptance" and "Unit"
 * use the many $specs2 ${"matchers" ~/ Matchers} to specify precisely the expected behavior of your application
 * ${"run" ~/ Runners} your specification and output results in various formats
