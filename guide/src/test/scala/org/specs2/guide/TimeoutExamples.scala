### One example

Some examples take too long to run and it is desirable to interrupt them if they do. This is the purpose of the `org.specs2.specification.AroundTimeout` trait: ${snippet{
import org.specs2.specification.AroundTimeout
import scala.concurrent.duration._

class MySpec extends Specification with AroundTimeout
                                   with ExecutionEnvironment {
def is(implicit ee: ExecutionEnv) = s2"""

  this should not take too long ${upTo(1.second)(e1)}

"""

  def e1 = { 1 + 1 === 2 }
}
}}

Note that you need to extend the `org.specs2.specification.ExecutionEnvironment` trait to get an implicit `ExecutionEnv` in order to use this functionality (read more on the $ExecutionEnvironments).

### The whole specification

You can also declare a timeout for all the examples of a given specification with the `org.specs2.specification.ExamplesTimeout` trait:${snippet{
import org.specs2.specification.ExamplesTimeout

class MySpec extends Specification with ExamplesTimeout
                                   with ExecutionEnvironment {
def is(implicit ee: ExecutionEnv) = s2"""

  this should not take too long $e1
  this one too                  $e2

"""

  def e1 = { 1 + 1 === 2 }
  def e2 = { 2 + 2 === 4 }
}
}}

With the `ExamplesTimeout` trait you can control the duration of the time out by passing the `timeout` argument on the command-line (in milliseconds).
