/**
 * Effects of type R, returning a value of type A
 *
 * It is implemented as a "Free-er" monad with extensible effects:
 *
 *  - the "pure" case is a pure value of type A
 *
 *  - the "impure" case is:
 *     - a disjoint union of possible effects
 *     - a continuation of type X => Eff[R, A] indicating what to do if the current effect is of type M[X]
 *       this type is represented by the `Arrs` type
 *
 * The monad implementation for this type is really simple:
 *
 *  - `point` is Pure
 *  - `bind` simply appends the binding function to the `Arrs` continuation
 *
 * Important:
 *
 *  The list of continuations is NOT implemented as a type sequence but simply as a
 *    Vector[Any => Eff[R, Any]]
 *
 *  This means that various `.asInstanceOf` are present in the implementation and could lead
 *  to burns and severe harm. Use with caution!
