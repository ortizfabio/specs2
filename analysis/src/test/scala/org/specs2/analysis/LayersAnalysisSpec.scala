class LayersAnalysisSpec extends script.Specification with DataLayers with Grouped with ScalaCheck { def is = s2"""


 It is possible to specify dependencies between packages as 'layers'. A `Layers` object is an ordered sequence of other `Layer`s.

 A `Layer` is simply a list of package names, with possibly a prefix to factor out their common package by default all the packages are supposed to have corresponding class files in the src/main/scala directory, but it is possible to specify another directory.

 If all dependencies are respected between any 2 packages of different layers, there must be no unsatisfied dependencies
 otherwise, it must display the failing dependencies
                                                                                                                        """
