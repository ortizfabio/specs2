Maintenance version.

## Improvements

 * added the `ExamplesTimeout` trait to the library [#322](http://github.com/etorreborre/specs2/issues/322)
 * only mutable versions of the `Context` traits now extend the `Scope` trait (to avoid possible missed expectations in acceptance specifications)
 
## Fixes

 * fixed the use of matchers with contain(allOf(...)) and an empty seq [#319](http://github.com/etorreborre/specs2/issues/319)
 * control expectations effects when combining match results [#320](http://github.com/etorreborre/specs2/issues/320)
 * changed the signature of `EventuallyMatchers.eventually` to avoid overloading conflicts with `EventuallyResults.eventually` [#323](http://github.com/etorreborre/specs2/issues/323)
 * added a check for the use of Expectations with Scope - thanks to @maximn for the PR! [#321](http://github.com/etorreborre/specs2/issues/321)
 * used a `s2` string for the datatable example in the guide to get a better display
