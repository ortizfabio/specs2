## Improvements

 * new User Guide (with lots more pages and a search box)

 * lightweight `Spec` trait to import less implicits in scope and get better compilation times
 * brand new Html printer based on [Pandoc](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc)
 * more ScalaCheck functionalities (set parameters from the command line, set `Gen/Arbitrary/Pretty` instances at the property level)
 * examples can now access the "Environment" (the command line arguments, the file system, the execution context, ...)
 * "online" specifications (examples can create examples)
 * new website
 
## Main API changes

 * new packaging for `Specification` concepts: `org.specs2.specification.{core, create, dsl, process}` 
 * new `Fragment` implementation
 * `Runner/Reporter/Printer/Fold` api for executing and reporting specifications
 * `BeforeAll, BeforeEach, ForEach, AfterEach, AfterAll` name changes for executing actions before all examples, before one example, with some specific data for each example... (previous names, like `FixtureExample`, now replaced with `ForEach` are deprecated)
 * deprecated the `TimeConversions` trait in favor of `scala.concurrent.duration._`
