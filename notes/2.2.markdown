This version brings small improvements and fixes on top of 2.1.1

## Important!

With the use of string interpolation for acceptance specifications the "old" style using operators is now deprecated (to simplify the implementation and avoid bugs).
The next version (2.3) will still compile specifications written with the "old" style but their display will not be correct (it will miss newlines).

## Improvements

 * added the possibility to specify given/when/then steps without extractors
 * added the possibility to start a GWT scenario with when steps only returning values
 * implemented the new test-interface for sbt 0.13
 * added a "stay informed" section on the welcome page with a link to the twitter account
 * iterators can now use the `haveSize` matcher
 * moved the implicit conversion for Scope to `ScopedExpectations` trait used by `ThrownExpectations` to use this conversion when it makes the most sense
 * improved support for Hamcrest matchers using the `Matcher.describeMismatch` method
 * show the original values for adapted matchers
 * added some documentation for the use of `AsResult.effectively` in the case of a mutable specification
 * added a `OneExpectationPerProp` trait for ScalaCheck to count only one expectation per property (instead of 100 by default)

## Fixes

 * using `System.getProperty` instead of `System.getProperties` to avoid the need for write permissions [#177](https://github.com/etorreborre/specs2/issues/177)
 * added the possibility to partially match strings in multiline strings [#179](https://github.com/etorreborre/specs2/issues/179)
 * fixed the generation of titles when using the markdown exporter
 * removing **all** spaces for `beEqual.ignoreSpace` and added `beEqual.trimmed` if we just want to trim strings [#181](https://github.com/etorreborre/specs2/issues/181)
 * set the proper name on the test-interface events [#184](https://github.com/etorreborre/specs2/issues/184)
 * added a toString method on SpecFailureAssertionFailedError to get better reporting with Jumi [#185](https://github.com/etorreborre/specs2/issues/185). Thanks to @orfjackal for the PR
 * `inOrder` results must check results with the `Expectations` trait when using Mockito and mutable specifications [#186](https://github.com/etorreborre/specs2/issues/186)
 * fixed the use of `AllExpectations` in a mutable spec with scopes
 * fixed the return type of the `failure/skipped`... methods so that they can be used at the end of an example in a mutable spec
 * using the pattern flags for the =~(pattern) matcher [#188](https://github.com/etorreborre/specs2/issues/188)
 * fixed the `contain(exactly())` matcher when there are no elements to check
 * added `and/or` methods on `MatchResult` taking a `Result` [#190](https://github.com/etorreborre/specs2/issues/190)
 * protected against null messages in thrown exceptions
