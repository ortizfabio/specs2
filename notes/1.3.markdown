This version adds new features on top of 1.2:

 * more consistent ScalaCheck implicits + syntactic sugar to use custom `Arbitrary` instances
 * decoupled a `run` method on the specs2.run object for easier execution of specifications in the console (inspired by Bill Venners's work on the ScalaTest shell)
 * html files can be executed from Intellij by adding the `html` option in the test options
 * added an example showing how to create a index.html page with links to all the specifications
 * refactored the use of scalaz. specs2 now has its own version of the scalaz classes packaged as `org.specs2.internal.scalaz` and published as a separate dependency. This allows the scalaz team to use specs2 to specify other scalaz versions.
 
And some fixes:

 * `BeEqualTo` matcher is now a Matcher[Any] to be better aligned with the `==` method. `BeTypedEqualTo` or `be_===` can be used for typed equality
 * `BeEqualTo` is more resilient to nulls
 * AssertionErrors are treated as Failures
 * `InOrder` calls bug in Mockito
 * The filtering of examples works ok now with `\r` characters
 * JUnit Description methods return expected values for `getTestClass`, `getDisplayName`...
