[*fixed notes for 3.1*]

Maintenance release with a few new features

## Improvements

 - report exceptions stacktraces in the `NotifierRunner`
 - added locations on `ok` and `ko` results
 - added `scalaz.concurrent.Future` matchers
 - added the `|*` operator to execute `DataTables` concurrently (see the User Guide)
 - added a User Guide section to explain the use of the `LanguageFeatures` trait for postfixOps [#343](https://github.com/etorreborre/specs2/issues/343)
 - added the `<==>` operator to declare the equivalence of 2 results (this is useful when testing with ScalaCheck)
 
## Fixes

 * fixed the indentation for forms in the console
 * make directories before copying a file
 * don't get the end position of expressions when `-Yrangepos` is not specified
 * fixed the selection of examples where the description is some code
 * use the console logger with `specs2.run` (the output was missing before)
