This version is mostly a bug fix release for 2.0

New features

Improvements
 
 * added a better failure message for Option.which matcher [#167](https://github.com/etorreborre/specs2/issues/167)
 * added the possibility to specify the pegdown timeout when parsing specifications with Markdown text
 * updated the Scalaz version to 7.0.2
 
Fixes

 * fixed the collection matcher combinators when working with thrown expectations [#169](https://github.com/etorreborre/specs2/issues/169)
