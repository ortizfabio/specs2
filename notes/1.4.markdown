This version adds new features on top of 1.3:

 * A JUnit XML reporter to create [junit-xml files](http://etorreborre.github.com/specs2/guide/org.specs2.guide.Runners.html#Output+formats) usable for continuous integration
 * updated to the latest pegdown release
 * [Auto-examples](http://etorreborre.github.com/specs2/guide/org.specs2.guide.SpecStructure.html#Auto-Examples) can be used even if the specification class doesn't have the same name as the file containing it
 * added a `beAnInstanceOf` matcher
 * added a `haveLength` matcher (alias for `haveSize`)
 * the colors used for the text output [can be customized](http://etorreborre.github.com/specs2/guide/org.specs2.guide.Runners.html#Colors)
 * added a `mute` method on matchers to remove messages (used in Forms and Props to just color cells when there is a failure)
 * added a `see` method to create an html link to another specification without executing it
 * better [Contexts](http://etorreborre.github.com/specs2/guide/org.specs2.guide.SpecStructure.html#Contexts) description in the UserGuide
 * added the possibility to define an implicit Context to avoid duplication
 * removed the possibility to use the description of an Example in the body of the example (use the Given-When-Then support instead)
 * added a `be_==~` matcher to match with an implicit conversion
 * using sbt 0.10.0
  
And some fixes:

 * better display for Array expectables
 * filtering stacktraces for html output
 * various fixes for Forms and Properties evaluations
 * fixed the `ThrownExpectation` issue where mixing it to an Acceptance spec had no effect
 * fixed a sequencing issue when there are 2 consecutive Steps with no example in between
