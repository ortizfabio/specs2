Less-dependent version!

## Improvements

 * removed the external dependency on Scalaz-stream
 * new `specs2-cats` module: added `Xor` matchers for [cats](https://github.com/typelevel/cats)
 * doc: configure external links in ScalaDoc (thanks to Yang Bo)
 * core: extracted a `ThrownExpectable` trait to get thrown expectations with less possibility for clashes with `ScalaTest` methods  
 * sbt: extract tags from the specification to pass them to sbt (see [here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/36585241/use-sbt-tags-to-control-specs2-test-concurrency)).
   this allows sbt to run some specifications sequentially at the class level.

## Fixes

 * core: fallback to the normal instance if building a companion object doesn't work [#477](http://github.com/etorreborre/specs2/issues/477)
 * matcher: check the order of xml nodes when using `beEqualToIgnoringSpace.ordered` [#474](http://github.com/etorreborre/specs2/issues/474)
