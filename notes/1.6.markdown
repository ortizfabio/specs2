This version adds new features on top of 1.5. The first set of features rely on the storage of execution results for each run (in the `specs2-report/stats` directory by default):

 * executing an index page with `see` links referencing other specifications now displays their status correctly
 * it is possible to execute only previously failed/error examples with the `wasIssue` argument
 * it is possible to display only pending, or skipped examples with a status flag. For example `show("!o")` will only show errors and skipped examples
 * reports now show the differences with the previous execution: `3 examples, 1 failure (-1), 1 error (+1)`
 * storing results can be completely deactivated with the `neverStore` argument
 * the arguments api has evolved a bit because the number of arguments exceeds the maximum number of function parameters (see the Runners guide for the complete description of the Arguments api and new arguments)

The other features are:
 
 * html reports with issues have a link to display only the failed examples
 * DataTables are now [contravariant](https://github.com/etorreborre/specs2/commit/38f684f7747dda3e1ac05271e8f25fe7848f7e39)
 * an exception is thrown if a null matcher is passed to an expectable
 * new `ThrownMessages` trait for [generic integration with other libraries](https://groups.google.com/d/topic/specs2-users/tskUhL5G4jE/discussion)
 * new `haveInterface` matcher
 * new mutable `BeforeAfter` trait (was missing,...)
  
And some fixes:

 * fixed the issue with -Dcolor=false not being recognized
 * reworked the Given/When/Then specifications indentation so that formatting fragments can now be used to adjust the display
 * fixed a [typechecking issue](https://groups.google.com/d/topic/specs2-users/mYyGuvBYMwI/discussion) with Mockito specifications
 * fixed auto-examples [when no 'end' fragment is used](https://groups.google.com/d/topic/specs2-users/mEpVvVSSqHA/discussion) at the end of the specification 
 * fixed [issue 30](https://github.com/etorreborre/specs2/issues/30): IndexOutOfBoundsException with auto-examples
