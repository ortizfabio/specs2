New release!

## New features

 - added a `TypecheckMatchers` to verify that a given piece of code typechecks (can also be used with `PendingUntilFixed`)

```
typecheck {
    """
  // there must be a Monoid instance for Text
  Monoid[Text].zero
    """
} must succeed
```

## Improvements

 - the `SpecificationFinder` will not fail when one specification fails to instantiate
 - count the number of linked specifications in statistics
 - added a flag (`#`) to report the specification title in the console or not
 
## Fixes

 * added back the `MockitoFunctions` trait to `Mockito` [#353](https://github.com/etorreborre/specs2/issues/353)
 * added `anyBoolean` to the list of Mockito matchers
 * don't publish the specs2 jar [#354](https://github.com/etorreborre/specs2/issues/354)
 * fixed the `MatchResult.mute` to remove details for `MatchFailure`
 * fixed the `ToList` instance for the `GWT` spec
 * the `Printer` trait only deals with `SpecStructure` (and not `SpecificationStructure` which depends on the environment)
