This version is mostly a migration to Scala 2.10.0

With one improvement:

 * removed the unnecessary newline between specification names when running with `xonly`
 
And 2 fixes:

 * fixed [issue 120](https://github.com/etorreborre/specs2/issues/120): matchers evaluation with `and`
 * fixed the creation of steps when the action throws an exception
