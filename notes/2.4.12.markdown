Maintenance version.

## Improvements

 * it is possible to use `Int`, `Boolean`, `String` and `Traversable` matchers with JsonMatchers [#306](https://github.com/etorreborre/specs2/issues/306) and [#307](https://github.com/etorreborre/specs2/issues/307)

 * moved the setting of stacktraces on match results to the Expectations to a method. This means that now the `MustMatchers` *object* can be used outside `specs2` without filling-in stacktraces (which impacts performances). On the other hand, when you mix  `MustMatchers` *trait*, `MatchResults` will get a location (by generating a stacktrace). This behaviour can be deactivated by mixing-in the `org.specs2.matcher.NoExpectationStackTrace` trait

## Fixes

 * added details to a forall check when one of the checks has failure details
 * various small fixes on collection matchers
