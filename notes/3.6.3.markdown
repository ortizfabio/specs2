Maintenance version.

## Improvements

 * updated scalaz-stream - it is not necessary to add bintray as a resolver anymore
 * updated to Scala 2.11.7
 
## Fixes 

 * rethrow unexpected exceptions when using `not(throwA[X])` [#395](http://github.com/etorreborre/specs2/issues/3895)
 * evaluate ScalaCheckProperty properties only once
 * fixed a Notifier bug where `close` can be called several times for the same block (this creates an Exception with IntelliJ)
