Maintenance release

## Improvements

 - added a `timefactor` argument to multiply all durations by a constant when awaiting Futures [#348](https://github.com/etorreborre/specs2/issues/348)
 - removed the overloaded `await` method to create `Future[Matcher[T]]` from `Matcher[T]` and introduced `awaitFor(timeout)`, `retryAwait(retries)` when only using a timeout or a number of retries [#349](https://github.com/etorreborre/specs2/issues/349)
