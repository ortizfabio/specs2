This version adds new features on top of 1.6.1:

 * Mockito settings (name, defaultAnswer, extraInterfaces) can be specified during mock creation
 * issue #39: results are now printed to the console as soon as executed
 * added an implicit function to allow the use of generators in ScalaCheck properties: `forAll(generator) { p => p must matchSomething }`
 * added `forall/foreach/atLeastOnce` to check a function returning a `Result` several times: `((i: Int) => i must be_<=(2)).forall(Seq(1, 2, 3, 4))` or
   `forall(Seq((1, 2), (3, 4))) { case (a, b) => a must be_<(b) } }`
 * added `TerminationMatchers` to check if that a block of code terminates within a reasonable amount of time
 * added `containAllOf/containAnyOf` collection matchers taking sequences as parameters (instead of varargs)
 * added new matchers to allow Parser matchers to partially consume their input: `beAPartialSuccess` (issue #46)
 
And fixes some issues:

 * delayed a MatchResult evaluation when transforming it to a Prop avoid issues with properties implication
 * display of Arrays in failures like `Array(1, 2) === Array(1, 3)`
 * issue #40: incorrect line number for a failure in a mutable specification
 * issue #41: missing specification title when using sbt
 * issue #45: fixed the evaluation of `result1 and result2` so that `result2` doesn't get evaluated if `result1` succeeds
 * issue #46: fixed the parser matchers which should consume all input 
 * issue #47: proper display of DataTables in the console
 * fixed the `find.withGroups` matcher (was not matching several groups)
