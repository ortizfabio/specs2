/**
 * Snippets of code can be extracted from interpolated specification strings.
 *
 * When you want to specify that a piece of code must be included in the specification output, you can use the `snippet`
 * method to execute a this code and use the text in the output. If you just want to output part of the code you need to
 * delimit it with some comments `// 8<-------` (with as many dashes as you want)
 *
 * Generally the last value of a snippet will be displayed separately but it is possible to avoid this by using the `mute`
 * method on a Snippet.
 *
 * It is also possible to check that the result value is equal to a specific value by using the `check[R : AsResult](f: T => R)` method.
 *
