A Form is a generic table which has an optional title and rows. Each row contains cells which can be created from
Fields, Props or other Forms.

A Form is usually created in a specification with expected values so that it can be displayed with the rest of the text
(whereas a DataTable is only displayed when there are failures. It is then "implemented" with actual values in an example.
Upon execution a Form will return a Result value summarizing the execution of each Prop it embeds.

Creation
========
                                                                                                                        
A Form can be created                                                                                                 
  + with a title
  + with one field on one row
  + with two fields on one row
  + with a title and one field on each row
  + with a property on one row
  + with another Form on one row
  + with a seq of fields on one row
  + with a seq of fields on one row - and no title
  + with tabs
  + with a seq of Rows

  from a DataTable
    + the Form header is the DataTable header
    + with an additional column for failure messages
    + the form rows are the DataTable rows

Display
=======

A Form can be displayed, showing expected values
  with its title
    + if present: | title |
    + if absent: the text is empty

  the columns must be aligned for
    + a simple form with 2 fields $address1
    + a simple form with 3 fields, 2 on one row and one on the second row $address2
    + a form with more fields and rows $address3
    + a form with an inlined form $address4

  with one row only
    + and one cell
    + and 2 cells

  with a title and one row
    + and one cell
    + and 2 cells

Execution
=========

A Form can be executed as a success
  + then its rows are a success
  + and row cells are a success

A Form can be executed as a failure
  + then its rows are a failure
  + and row cells are a failure

 A Form can be executed
   + then all its rows are executed

Other
=====

Forms rows and cells have equals/hashcode methods
  + row1 == row1
  + cell1 == cell1

Forms can be displayed as xhtml
  + the title must span all columns

A form can be added to another
  + inlined
                                                                                                            """
