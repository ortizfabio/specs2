 It is possible to check if a block of code terminates
   with a default number of retries and default sleep time
     + if it succeeds
     + if it fails

   with a specified number of retries and sleep time
     + if it succeeds after 50 ms
     + if it fails

   + if the termination fails, the computation is stopped
   + We can write 'action must not terminate'

 We should be able to observe that an action unblocks another
   + with a when clause
   with an onlyWhen clause
     + if action1 terminates after action 2 -> success
     + if action1 terminates before action 2 -> failure
     + if action1 terminates before action 2 -> failure with a specific message
     + if action1 doesn't terminate after action 2 -> failure

  We should not overflow the stack
    + when a very large number of retries is provided
                                                                                                """
